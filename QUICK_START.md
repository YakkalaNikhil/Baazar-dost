      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write orders
    match /orders/{orderId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow all authenticated users to read products and suppliers
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
